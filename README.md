# 🌿 Land Cover in Sumatra (2012–2022)

## 📝 Project Overview

This project investigates land cover change in **Sumatra, Indonesia** from 2012 to 2022. It focuses on forest loss, agricultural expansion, and fire hotspot dynamics — especially the extreme fire year **2015**, when over 250,000 hotspots were detected due to intense El Niño-driven drought. Using geospatial datasets, we analyzed how fire activity overlaps with **peatlands** and **concession boundaries** (Oil Palm and Wood Fibre), and how policy shifts around 2020 may have influenced land use trends. The findings support sustainable land management and fire risk mitigation strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods Used

- **QGIS**: Spatial data preparation, raster/vector processing, and map generation  
- **Python**: Data preprocessing and visualization (using `pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- **R**: Statistical analysis, trend modeling, and plotting (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`)  
- **Data sources**:
  - [ESA CCI](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)
  - [NASA FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/)
  - [Global Forest Watch](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/)

## 📊 Project Highlights

- ✅ Significant **forest loss (8.3%)** and **agriculture expansion (6.1%)**
- 🔥 Fire hotspots peaked in **2015** and **2019**, aligned with **El Niño** and **IOD** patterns
- 🌱 Hotspots heavily concentrated on **peatlands** and within **Oil Palm/Wood Fibre concessions**
- 📉 Notable **trend reversal after 2020**, possibly due to national moratorium and FOLU Net Sink strategy
- 🌫️ Linkage between fire activity in Sumatra and **transboundary haze** in Singapore
